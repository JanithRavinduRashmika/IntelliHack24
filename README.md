<h1 align="center" style="font-size: 48px;">🚀 IntelliHack NextGen 2024 - Hackathon First Round</h1>



This repository contains solutions to the questions I received during the first round of the IntelliHack NextGen 2024 hackathon. The solutions are organized into four folders, each corresponding to a question (Q1 - Q4). You may find sample data or dummy data included to demonstrate the solutions.

## 🗃️ Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

<strong>📁 IntelliHack24</strong>
<ul>
    <li><strong>📁 Q1</strong></li>
    <li><strong>📁 Q2</strong></li>
    <li><strong>📁 Q3</strong></li>
    <li><strong>📁 Q4</strong></li>      
</ul>

Each folder contains:
- The code used to solve the question 🖥️
- Any relevant data files (dummy data for demonstration) 📊
- Notes or explanations regarding the solution 📝



## 📝 Problem Statements and Solutions

Here’s a quick demo of how the solutions work, using dummy data:

### 🌾 Q1 - Crop Prediction

The objective of this solution is to predict the most appropriate crop based on environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and soil quality. Machine learning techniques are employed to analyze the given data and recommend the best-suited crop.

### 💬 Q2 - Intent Recognition

This solution aims to identify the intent of a given conversation. The possible intents include offensive, compliment, informal greeting, farewell, formal greet, and inquiry. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the model accurately detects the intention behind each conversation.

🤖 Q3 - Smart Bank Chatbot

The goal of this solution is to create an intelligent chatbot for a banking system. The chatbot can efficiently handle common banking queries like balance inquiries, transaction history, and general account information. It enhances the customer experience by providing quick, accurate, and automated responses through a conversational interface.

### 🛒 Q4 - Supermarket Sales Analysis

This solution involves performing data analysis on a supermarket sales dataset to gain insights into sales trends and customer preferences. By analyzing patterns and visualizing data, the solution highlights the best-selling products and identifies seasonal trends, helping supermarkets make informed decisions.
