# IntelliHack NextGet 2024 - Hackathon First Round

Welcome to my repo for the IntelliHack NextGet 2024 hackathon! 🎉 This repository contains my solutions for the first round questions.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repo is organized into 4 folders, corresponding to the questions I worked on:

- **Q1** - Question 1 Solution 💡
- **Q2** - Question 2 Solution 🧠
- **Q3** - Question 3 Solution 🔧
- **Q4** - Question 4 Solution 🏆

Each folder contains:
- The code used to solve the question 🖥️
- Any relevant data files (dummy data for demonstration) 📊
- Notes or explanations regarding the solution 📝

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the solutions locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/IntelliHack-NextGet-2024.git
    cd IntelliHack-NextGet-2024
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the solutions**:
   - For Q1:
     ```bash
     python Q1/solution.py
     ```
   - For Q2:
     ```bash
     python Q2/solution.py
     ```
   - For Q3:
     ```bash
     python Q3/solution.py
     ```
   - For Q4:
     ```bash
     python Q4/solution.py
     ```

## 🧑‍💻 Demo

Here’s a quick demo of how the solutions work, using dummy data:

### Q1 Solution 💡
- **Objective**: Solve the problem related to data cleaning and transformation.
- **Example**: In the `Q1` folder, the script performs basic data cleaning tasks on a dummy dataset (such as missing values and data normalization).
- **Output**: Cleaned data ready for analysis.

### Q2 Solution 🧠
- **Objective**: Apply machine learning for prediction tasks.
- **Example**: In the `Q2` folder, a simple model is trained using dummy data to predict an outcome based on features.
- **Output**: Model performance metrics and predicted values.

### Q3 Solution 🔧
- **Objective**: Perform feature engineering on a dataset.
- **Example**: In the `Q3` folder, features are created from dummy data, followed by model training.
- **Output**: Enhanced features and trained model.

### Q4 Solution 🏆
- **Objective**: Optimize a model for better performance.
- **Example**: In the `Q4` folder, hyperparameter tuning is done to optimize a model’s accuracy.
- **Output**: Best-performing model with optimal parameters.

## 📊 Data Used

- Dummy data is used for demonstration purposes in all questions. These datasets simulate real-world problems and their solutions.
- Feel free to replace them with real data for practical use.
